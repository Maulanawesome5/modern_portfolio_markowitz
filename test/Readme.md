## Just Note

Beberapa hal yang mungkin akan menjadi suatu catatan untuk diri saya, yaitu

### **1. Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)**

> Modern Portfolio Theory, or also known as mean-variance analysis is a mathematical process which allows the user to maximize returns for a given risk level.

It was formulated by **Harry Markowitz** and while it is not the only optimization technique known, it is the most widely used.

MPT assumes that all investors are risk-averse, i.e, if there is a choice between low risk and high risk portfolios with the same returns, an investor will choose one with the low risk.

So, what is the MPT all about ?

MPT encourages diversification of assets. It says that a high variance asset A if combined with diverse asset B and C, where A, B, and C have little to no correlation, can give us a portfolio with low variance on return

### **2. Efficient Frontier**

We know every asset in a portfolio has its own rate expected returns and risks. It is possible to create multiple combinations of assets that can provide high returns for a pre-defined risk level.

Likewise, there can be multiple portfolios that give lowest risk for a pre-defined expected return.

> Efficient frontier is a graph with ‘returns’ on the Y-axis and ‘volatility’ on the X-axis. It shows the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given risk level or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return.

Portfolios that lie outside the efficient frontier are sub-optimal because they do not provide either enough return for the level of risk or have a higher risk for the defined rate of return.
